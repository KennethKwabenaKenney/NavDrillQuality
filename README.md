# NavDrill Quality (NavDQ)

NavDrill Quality (NavDQ) is an open-source software tool designed to support quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) of underground production drilling and blasting operations. The software enables spatial integration of drill navigation data into mine coordinate systems, allowing systematic comparison between designed and as-drilled drill holes and preparation of quantitative QA/QC metrics.

NavDQ is intended for use by mining engineers, geospatial engineers, and technical personnel involved in drill-and-blast planning, QA/QC review, and drilling performance analysis.

## Key Features

- Transformation of drill navigation data from drill-local coordinate systems into the mine spatial reference system
- Spatial reconstruction of as-drilled drill hole geometries
- Preparation of quantitative QA/QC metrics for drilling accuracy and deviation analysis
- Preservation and structuring of drilling metadata, including rock mass–related information
- Generation of industry-standard outputs for downstream analysis and visualization
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring inputs and executing workflows without direct code interaction

## Supported Input Data

NavDQ processes the following input datasets:

- Drill Design IREDES files
- Navigation Drill Return IREDES files generated by underground drill rigs
- Designed drill hole datasets exported from mine planning platforms (CSV format), thus csv/excel dataset containing drill hole design info such as RingID, HoleID, 
  Hole colar and Toe XYZ coordinates, 

### File Naming Requirements

For correct association of design and navigation data, the following naming conventions are required:

- Drill Design IREDES files and Navigation Drill Return IREDES files must correspond to the same production ring and share the same base file name.
- Navigation Drill Return IREDES files must include the prefix **`DQ`** at the beginning of the file name.

#### Example (single ring within a stope):

- Drill Design IREDES file:  (Stope Name_Ring Identifier)
  `DIT_4700_120ST1_R1` 
- Navigation Drill Return IREDES file:  (DQStope Name_Ring Identifier)
  `DQDIT_4700_120ST1_R1_XXXXXXX`

where `R1` denotes the ring number and additional characters may follow the ring identifier in the navigation Drill Return IREDES file name.

NavDQ processes drilling data on a per-stope basis, where each stope may consist of multiple production rings.

## Outputs

NavDQ generates multiple analysis-ready outputs, including:

- Spatially referenced as-drilled drill hole datasets
- IREDES-formatted files suitable for as-drilled and as-built import workflows
- DXF representations of as-drilled drill hole polylines
- Structured CSV-based quality reports containing quantitative QA/QC metrics and associated drilling metadata

All outputs are designed to integrate with existing mine planning, design, and visualization tools without requiring changes to established operational workflows.

## Software Design Overview

NavDQ is implemented as a modular processing pipeline that separates data ingestion, parsing, spatial transformation, metric preparation, and output generation into distinct stages. Spatial alignment between drill-local and mine coordinate systems is treated as a core component of the workflow, ensuring consistency and traceability between input data and derived outputs.

The software prioritizes compatibility with industry-standard formats (IREDES, DXF, CSV) to facilitate integration across different mine planning environments. A graphical user interface is provided to support practical use in operational engineering settings.
